# RSNA-MICCAI Brain Tumor Radiogenomic Classification

Abstractâ€”In the quest to improve the diagnosis and treatment of glioblastoma, this research delves into the predictive modeling of the genetic subtype of the tumor using MRI scans. Building upon the top solutions from the RSNA and MICCAI Society's Kaggle competition, this study sought to enhance the prediction accuracy for the presence of MGMT promoter methylation. While the foundational solutions provided a robust starting point, replicating and advancing them presented a series of challenges. Through rigorous data preprocessing, leveraging pretrained foundational models, and iterative experimentation, the study achieved marked improvements in predictive accuracy. The methodologies not only underscore the potential of non-invasive tumor classification but also highlight the importance of transparent, reproducible research in the domain of medical imaging and machine learning. The findings pave the way for more personalized, efficient, and less invasive diagnostic procedures for glioblastoma patients, offering a promising direction for future oncological research.
